# Web Scraping Example

This is an example web scraping project. What it is doing is going to newegg.com for laptops and recording names and prices of available laptops.
The information gathered will be written to a file.


Requirements:

Install python 3.9 or higher.
Install pip for python: _python get-pip.py_ in the terminal.
If pip is already installed, check that pip is up to date with:  _pip install --upgrade pip_

Download the executtable for your machine and update the binary path for each browser:

Firefox: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

Chrome: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Follow this youtube video to set your binary path for the WebDriver. This is for Chrome but 
the same thing can be done for the Firefox geckodriver:
